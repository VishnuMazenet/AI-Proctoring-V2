To detect the face and verify if the face which is rendering by the webcam is a valid user or not. I have done three task in it. I have used tensorflow.js and face-api.js libraries in this projects.

Make sure to have a folder name "labels" and an another folder with the valid user name as the folder's name. Save the valid user's photos in that folder in .png format.

And for the ImgVerification create an another folder name sample-folder and save all the sample photos in this folder.

Capture.png is just for capturing the photo throght the webcam in .png format.

Also make sure to change the code(File locations and their names) according to your choice.
